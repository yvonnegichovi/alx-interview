# 0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix

## Description

This project involves implementing an in-place algorithm to rotate an \( n \times n \) 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. This challenge requires a good understanding of matrix manipulation and in-place operations in Python.

## Key Concepts

### Matrix Representation in Python
- Understanding how 2D matrices are represented using lists of lists in Python.
- Accessing and modifying elements in a 2D matrix.

### In-place Operations
- Performing operations on data without creating a copy of the data structure.
- The importance of minimizing space complexity by modifying the matrix in place.

### Matrix Transposition
- Understanding the concept of transposing a matrix (swapping rows and columns).
- Implementing matrix transposition as a step in the rotation process.

### Reversing Rows in a Matrix
- Manipulating rows of a matrix by reversing their order as part of the rotation process.

### Nested Loops
- Using nested loops to iterate through 2D data structures like matrices.
- Modifying elements within nested loops to achieve the desired rotation.

## Resources

### Python Official Documentation
- [Data Structures](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html) (list comprehensions, nested list comprehension)
- [More on Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists)

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.10)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.8.0)
- You are not allowed to import any module
- All modules and functions must be documented
- All your files must be executable

## Tasks

### 0. Rotate 2D Matrix
#### Mandatory
Given an \( n \times n \) 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.

- Prototype: `def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):`
- Do not return anything. The matrix must be edited in-place.
- You can assume the matrix will have 2 dimensions and will not be empty.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""
Test 0x07 - Rotate 2D Matrix
"""
rotate_2d_matrix = __import__('0-rotate_2d_matrix').rotate_2d_matrix

if __name__ == "__main__":
    matrix = [
        [1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6],
        [7, 8, 9]
    ]

    rotate_2d_matrix(matrix)
    print(matrix)
```

Expected Output:
```plaintext
[[7, 4, 1],
 [8, 5, 2],
 [9, 6, 3]]
```
